originally cloned from [MakeWindows10GreatAgain](https://github.com/TokinRing/MakeWindows10GreatAgain) and optimized to my own preference.

MakeWindows10GreatAgain is a script to turn off and remove Windows bloatware and spyware.

1. Open a PowerShell prompt with elevated privileges.

2. Set the execution policy to unrestricted:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force`

3. Run the script:

`.\MakeWindows10GreatAgain`

4. When the script finishes, press Enter to reboot the system.
